# Wireframing
## What is wireframing ?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI.It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
